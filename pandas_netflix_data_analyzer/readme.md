🎬 Netflix Data Analyzer (Pandas Project)
📌 About the Project

This project is a beginner–friendly data analysis tool built with Python and Pandas.
The dataset used is the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset
 (CSV file).

The main purpose of this project is not just Netflix-specific insights, but to practice dataset handling, manipulation, and extracting meaningful information from real-world data.

🔑 Why this project?
Understanding how to clean, analyze, and query datasets is the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

AI/ML models rely heavily on quality data.

Before training models, data scientists spend ~70% of their time on cleaning and preparing data.

This project helps build that mindset by working hands-on with a real dataset.

⚙️ Features Implemented
1️⃣ Load Dataset from User Path

User provides a CSV file path at runtime.

If the file path is incorrect → error is handled gracefully.

Converts the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame for easy processing.

2️⃣ Dataset Exploration

df.head() → Preview first rows.

df.info() → General info (columns, data types, null values).

df.describe() → Quick statistics.

3️⃣ Search by Movie/Show Title

Enter a keyword (case-insensitive).

Returns all matching results with:

Title

Type (Movie/TV Show)

Release Year

Duration

Genre

4️⃣ Count of Movies vs TV Shows

Uses value_counts() on the type column.

Shows how much Netflix content is movies vs TV shows.

5️⃣ Top 10 Countries with Most Content

Groups dataset by country.

Shows top 10 content-producing countries on Netflix.

6️⃣ Random Recommendation 🎲

Using DataFrame.sample()

Recommends a random Movie or TV Show from dataset.

Adds fun + real-world "recommendation system" flavor.

🧠 Learnings from the Project

How to load, clean, and query datasets.

Practical use of Pandas functions:

read_csv()

head() / info()

value_counts()

groupby()

sample()

Filtering with str.contains()

Importance of data quality before AI/ML.

Foundation for data preprocessing in Machine Learning pipelines.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo or download project folder.

Make sure Pandas is installed:

pip install pandas


(or use Anaconda interpreter where pandas is already available)

Run the project:

python src/main.py


Provide dataset file path (e.g.):

C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\netflix_titles.csv

📊 Future Improvements

Add genre-based recommendations.

Add visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn (charts for content trends).

Add year-wise analysis (e.g., which year Netflix added the most content).

Build a basic recommendation engine (similar content suggestion).

✨ Why This Project Matters

This project is a step into Data Science.
Before building ML models, you must know how to:

Handle missing data.

Filter and group data.

Generate meaningful insights.

Without clean, structured data → AI is useless.
That’s why data analysis is the backbone of AI & ML, and this project shows how datasets can be manipulated for insights.
